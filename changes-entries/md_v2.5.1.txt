  *) mod_md: update to version 2.5.1
     - Added support for ACME profiles with new directives MDProfile and
       MDProfileMandatory.
     - When installing a custom CA file via `MDCACertificateFile`, also set the
       libcurl option CURLSSLOPT_NO_REVOKE that suppresses complains by Schannel
       (when curl is linked with it) about missing CRL/OCSP in certificates.
     - Fixed handling of corrupted httpd.json and added test 300_30 for it.
       File is removed on error and written again. Fixes #369.
     - Added explanation in log for how to proceed when md_store.json could not be
       parsed and prevented the server start.
     - restored fixed to #336 and #337 which got lost in a sync with Apache svn
     - Add Issue Name/Uris to certificate information in md-status handler
     - MDomains with static certificate files have MDRenewMode "manual", unless
       "always" is configured.
