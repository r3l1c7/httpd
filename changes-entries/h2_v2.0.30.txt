  *) mod_http2: update to version 2.0.30
     - Fixed bug in handling over long response headers. When the 64 KB limit
       of nghttp2 was exceeded, the request was not reset and the client was
       left hanging, waiting for it. Now the stream is reset.
     - Added new directive `H2MaxHeaderBlockLen` to set the limit on response
       header sizes.
     - Fixed handling of Timeout vs. KeepAliveTimeout when first request on a
       connection was reset.
